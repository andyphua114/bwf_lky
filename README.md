## Exploratory Data Analysis on Singapore's First Ever Badminton World Champion

In this project, I was inspired by Loh Kean Yew's historic achievement of being the first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championships title at the BWF World Championships 2021 held in Huelva, Spain, I wanted to do some simple analysis on his meteoric rise to the top of the badminton world.

To start off, I felt that the BWF official website offers some match data that could be useful. Since I have just learnt about web scrapping, I decided to code and web scrape Loh Kean Yew's playing data from the BWF website.

First, I implemented the following to gather the dataset I require:
* Web scrape using BeautifulSoup and Selenium
* Extract data for chosen athelete (Loh Kean Yew)
* Export data to a csv file

Building off the data web scrapped from BWF website, I did a simple analysis on Loh Kean Yew's performance.
